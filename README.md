# AutomaticAttendance System By face recognition
 Face recognition is a step further than face detection. In face detection, we only detect the location of the human face in an image but in face recognition, we make a system that can identify humans. It can also be stated, "Face recognition is a broad challenge of verifying or identifying people in pictures or videos. Big tech giants are still working to make a faster, more accurate face recognition model."

**Project stages**

Face Detection: Locate faces and draw bounding boxes around faces and keep the coordinates of bounding boxes.

Face Alignments: Normalize the faces to be consistent with the training database.

Feature Extraction: Extract features of faces that will be used for training and recognition tasks.

Face Recognition: Matching the face against one or more known faces in a prepared database is complicated but getting started doesn’t have to be
